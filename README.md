# The Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm
 Knuth-Morris and Pratt introduce a linear time algorithm for the string matching problem. A matching time of O (n) is achieved by avoiding comparison with an element of 'S' that have previously been involved in comparison with some element of the pattern 'p' to be matched. i.e., backtracking on the string 'S' never occurs
